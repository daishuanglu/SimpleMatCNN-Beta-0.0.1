# SimpleMatCNN-Beta-0.0.1
This repository provides a minimum matlab implementation of the Convolutional Neural Network(CNN).

All the codes are implemented followed by the mathmatical derivation of CNN. 
This implementation is aiming at the understanding of the very details of CNN for students, researchers and scientists. NOT FOR INDUSTRY USE! 

This is the first Beta version.
Forwarding and backward propagtion using gradiend descent method are available in version 0.0.1. 
Only a CPU with any version of MATLAB are required to run this CNN! You can play with yourself. 
Around 30 mins will be taken for each round of forward and back propagation, so please be careful of the size. 

I'm welcoming everyone's advice for improving this code!!! Any contribution and help of this implementation are appreciated.

Hope we'll have our next version soon.

Good luck and have fun with deep learning,

Shuanglu Dai
